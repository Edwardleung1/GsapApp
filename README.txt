I created a simple one page layout to test some pretty cool animations in JavaScript with a library called GSAP.  

Even though the project is small I just wanted to practice my skills with animations in JavaScript cause it has been a concept I have always been interested in learning. 

I will definitely extend this project in the near future once I learn more about TimelineLite, and other cool complex animations.
